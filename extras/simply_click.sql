Usually these will have a web address (URL) looking something like this: www.your-isp.com/~your-user-name/. This type of site is useful for a family, teenagers, grandparents, etc. to stay in touch with each other. This type is not advisable for a small business because the URL is not search engine friendly and the limited server capabilities your hosting company offer may not be sophisticated enough for a small business website.

(2, 'Authors', 'Writer''s and Author''s websites are part of what''s known as the Writer''s or Author''s Platform in the publishing business. The platform includes, a website, a Facebook presence, blog, Twitter account, and the old fashioned mailing list. Many publishers will ask a prospective client about their platform. In other words, "If we publish your book, what sort of a reader base do you already have that we can count on to buy your new publication?" Fairly weighty request, wouldn''t you say? For now, let''s concentrate on the website part. A writers website would include a biography, a catalog of published books and works, perhaps excerpts from some works, links to publications on sites like Amazon.com, a link to the writer''s blog, reviews and comments on the author''s publications. You get the idea, and that is to build a following, a fan base to which future publications can be directly marketed. ', 'img/cat2.png', '2017-04-06 16:36:49'),

There could easily be over a hundred such sites that offer free photo sharing paid for by their online advertising. Also, many digital cameras and photo printers now come with software enabling mere mortals to create digital photo slide shows and upload them to the web. Most smart phones have apps to accomplish the same ends. ', 'img/cat3.png', '2017-04-06 16:36:49');
